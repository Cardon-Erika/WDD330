        <p>It is an interesting, but kind of like, "well, duh, why didn't I think of that" idea when developing for mobile - whether web pages or applications - to put the static buttons near the bottom where they are easy to reach. Personally, that is one thing that drives me crazy with my phone - when I have to manipulate my hand in a weird way to click on something.</p>

        <p>It was interesting studying events this past week. They had been a bit ellusive previously, but they made a lot more sense this week. I think it was from working in Google Analytics and Tag Manager. You tie almost all of the tracking to DOM events, and after spending many hours working on that, events in Javascript clicked this time through.</p>
        <p>I'm still a little confused when you use querySelector vs getElementById. I tend to use the later, but much of the code examples are in the former. I guess the benefit to the former is that you can target any type of element easily, whereas with getElementById you can only target element Id's.</p>

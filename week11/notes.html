        <p>This week I continued developing my final project. My big tasks for the week were streamlining some of the code, allowing players to be listed on a selected team, and implementing a favorite team bar.</p>
        <p>I found that many of the teams in my api did not have individual player information, so I also had to create some code to catch if there was nothing returned and let the user know there was nothing to display for that team.</p>
        <p>The favorites bar is still pretty crude. I have the main elements there, but I still need to add a few more team statistics to the bar, decide on the layout, and most importantly implement the local storage.</p>

        <p><strong>Week Ten: </strong>This week I started developing my final project. I implemented a pull of all countries for the api, which populates a dropdown. Then when a country is selected all of the leagues that are apart of that country are displayed. After clicking on a league, all of the teams in the league are displayed, along with their standings.</p>
